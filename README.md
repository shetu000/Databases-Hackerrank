Q1.*__Basics of Sets and Relations #1__*
```You are given two sets
Set A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
Set B = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
How many elements are present in  A U B?
Only enter the correct integer in the editor below. Do not include any extra spaces, tabs or newlines.
```


###### ANS: 8 (description: A U B={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8})


Q2: *__Basics of Sets and Relations #2__*
```Set A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
Set B = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
How many elements are present in ?
Only enter the correct integer in the answering box. Do not include any extra spaces, tabs or newlines.
```
###### ANS; 5

Q3: *__Basics of Sets and Relations #3__*

```
You are given two sets.
Set A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
Set B = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
How many elements are present in A - B?
Only enter the correct integer in the answering box. Do not include any extra spaces, tabs or newlines.
```
###### ANS: 1
###### A - B = {1,2,3,4,5,6} - {2,3,4,5,6,7,8} = {1}


Q4: *__Basics of Sets and Relations #4__*
```
You are given two sets.
Set A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
Set B = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
What is the total number of ordered pairs present in the Cartesian Product AXB  ? Only enter the correct integer in the answering box. Do not include any extra spaces, tabs or newlines.
```
###### ANS:42
###### set A = 6 values
###### set B = 7 values
###### so number pairs in cartesian product (AXB) = 6*7 =42
